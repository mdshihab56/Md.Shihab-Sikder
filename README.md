Hi, It's Shihab, a passionate BSc in CSE student at Daffodil Institute of IT, blending creativity with technology. From Graphic Design to Electronics and PCB Design.

I love diving deep into techâ€”building IoT applications, exploring environmental monitoring, and integrating APIs to bring ideas to life. Whether it's troubleshooting complex systems or crafting intuitive designs, I'm always eager to learn and innovate.

ðŸ“– When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me lost in novels, absorbing new perspectives that fuel my creativity. I'm here to build, collaborate, and connect with like-minded tech enthusiasts. Letâ€™s create something amazing together!
